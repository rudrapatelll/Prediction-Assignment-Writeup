# Practical Machine Learning Project ‚Äì Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset

This repository contains the final project submission for the **Practical Machine Learning** course by Johns Hopkins University on Coursera. The goal of the project is to predict the manner in which participants performed weight lifting exercises using data collected from wearable devices.

## üìÅ Files Included

- **`Prediction_Assignment_Writeup.Rmd`**  
  R Markdown file containing the full analysis and modeling process.

- **`Prediction_Assignment_Writeup.html`**  
  Compiled HTML report of the analysis. *(Open in a browser for best viewing experience.)*

- **`pml-training.csv`**  
  Training dataset used to build and validate the model.

- **`pml-testing.csv`**  
  Testing dataset used to generate predictions.
